                <h2>How to Use Clark College Events</h2>
                <p>
                    Welcome to the Clark College Events extension! Below are
                    some
                    common questions and answers to help you get the most out of
                    it.
                </p>

                <h3>1. What does this extension do?</h3>
                <p>
                    It shows "Today," "Earlier Today," and "Tomorrow" events
                    from
                    Clark College calendars. Click the down arrow next to any
                    event
                    in the list to expand and view more details.
                </p>

                <h3>2. How do I filter events on the main page?</h3>
                <p>
                    On the Home page, use the "Filter events..." input box to
                    quickly narrow down today's and tomorrow's events. As you
                    type, the extension will filter events by title, time, date,
                    or description in real-time. This helps you find specific
                    events without leaving the main page.
                </p>

                <h3>3. How do I search for upcoming events?</h3>
                <p>
                    Click "🔍 Search Events" in the navigation bar. Once you've
                    typed at least three characters, matching future events (up
                    to
                    60 days ahead) will appear under <em>Events</em> and
                    <em>Training
                        Events</em>. Click the down arrow next to any result to
                    expand and view full details.
                </p>

                <h3>4. What if I don't see any events?</h3>
                <p>
                    If no matching events exist for your query, you'll see "No
                    events found." If today or tomorrow truly has no scheduled
                    items, you'll see "No scheduled events."
                </p>

                <h3>5. How is "Earlier Today" determined?</h3>
                <p>
                    "Earlier Today" includes events whose start time was more
                    than
                    one hour ago (Pacific Time). If an event began over an hour
                    ago
                    (and is not an "All Day" item), it appears under <em>Earlier
                        Today</em>.
                </p>

                <h3>6. Why isn't my event showing?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Make sure the event is scheduled for today or tomorrow
                        if
                        you're viewing the pop-up page.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        On the search page, we look up to 60 days ahead—anything
                        beyond that window won’t appear.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>7. Where can I report bugs or request features?</h3>
